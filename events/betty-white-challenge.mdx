# Betty White Challenge

In the wake of Betty White's passing on December 31st, 2021, and to celebrate her 99 years of life and her lifelong commitment to animal welfare, we have committed to spaying or neutering 99 cats, along with many other animal rescue and fundraising organizations around the world.

## Our Progress

So far, since January 1st, 2022, we have spayed and neutered:

79 / 99 cats

## How We're Doing It

We are working with many local veterinarians and animal rescue organizations to help trap stray cats through our [TNR program](/about/tnr). Our volunteers have been working hard to trap these cats, bring them to a vet, and then provide them a place to recover before releasing them into the wild.

## How You Can Help

Please submit a [volunteer application](/volunteer) or contact us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/palsofpawssociety) to help us in our mission. We could use your help with trapping, transportation, and post-operation care.
