TNR - Trap Neuter Release
Image: Dozens of cat graphics in a pyramid shape beneath a single cat. Caption: A single stray cat can have up to three litters of kittens per year, with 4-6 kittens per litter. After just four months, each of those kittens can begin having litters of their own. Without TNR intervention, this total could potentially grow to over 100,000 cats in just four years.
