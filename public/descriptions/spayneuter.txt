Three million pets are estimated to be euthanized in shelters each year. One billion dollars is paid by taxpayers and humanitarian organizations each year to manage homeless pets. 75% of bite incidents involve intact male dogs. Spaying or neutering your pet does reduce their urge to roam, increase their lifespan and quality of life, and benefit your local community by reducing the stray animal population. Spaying or neutering your pet does not change their personality, make them any less "tough" or "manly", or hurt or cause them any distress.
