# Spays and Neuters

Getting animals in Northwest Mississippi spayed and neutered is the core component in our battle against pet overpopulation. The other services we provide, such as [adoption management](/about/adoption) or [animal transports](/about/transports) treat the symptoms of the problem, but our spay and neuter program attacks the problem at its source. The primary root cause of the pet overpopulation problem is that too many cats and dogs are allowed to remain unaltered and therefore breed uncontrollably. We hope to change this moving forward.

## Why Spay or Neuter?

Unaltered cats and dogs are more likely to roam and run away from home, they're more likely to be aggressive, and their lives are shorter. 

In line with our mission, we aim to provide our community with education surrounding spays and neuters. There are many myths and misconceptions about altering animals, and we hope to sway the public opinion in favor of getting every pet (that is not exclusively designated for breeding) spayed or neutered.

## Our Program

We aim to provide financial assistance, when funds are available, for spays and neuters in our community to help encourage everyone to get their animals altered. We also have a very successful [TNR (Trap, Neuter, Release) campaign](/about/tnr) to reduce the stray cat population.
