# Heartworm Treatment

Heartworms are a potentially fatal parasite that dogs can contract. Heartworm larvae are spread between dogs by mosquitos. Due to the overpopulation of stray dogs and the countless mosquito population in Mississippi, heartworms are a serious concern. All dogs should be treated regularly with heartworm prevention to avoid contracting heartworms, which will likely result in the dog's death or, at the very least, an expensive vet bill.

## Assistance

Where possible, Pals of Paws Society tries to provide heartworm treatment financial assistance to keep all dogs in our community safe and healthy. Acheiving our mission of reducing pet overpopulation will help, as less stray dogs means less chances for the parasite to spread, but we still must ensure that all dog owners are staying up to date with their pet's heartworm treatments.
